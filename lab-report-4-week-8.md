### Introduction
We are using two repositories in this lab report
1. My markdown-parse repository:
https://github.com/gnamithan/markdown-parse
2. The markdown-parse repository we reviewed: 
https://github.com/yayajjiang/markdown_inperson

### Snippet 1
#### Decide on what it should produce by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site

#### Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test
1. My markdown-parse:

2. The markdown-parse repository we reviewed:
#### For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
My implementation passes the test case that was written for snippet one

#### For the implementation you reviewed, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

### Follow-up Questions
#### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
#### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
#### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
